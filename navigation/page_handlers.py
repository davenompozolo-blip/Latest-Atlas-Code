ATLAS Page Handlers

This module provides handlers for all ATLAS pages.
Handlers are functions that render a specific page when called.

Phase 2A Approach:
- Start with simple delegation to existing code
- Gradually extract pages into standalone functions
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout

Design: Pragmatic > Perfect
"""

# This module will contain extracted page rendering logic.
# For now, we'll use a delegation pattern to call existing code in atlas_app.py

# Future: Extract page implementations into this module for better organization
